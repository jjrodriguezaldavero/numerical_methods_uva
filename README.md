**Advanced Numerical Methods in Many Body Physics**

*Juan José Rodríguez Aldavero*

Exercises for the Advanced Numerical Methods in Many Body Physics course offered by Amsterdam University and Prof. Philippe Corboz.

The course covers modern computational methods for the simulation
of many-body systems in condensed matter physics, including systems from classical
statistical physics and quantum many-body problems. 

Covered topics include:

• Monte Carlo methods for classical spin systems (Metropolis algorithm, cluster
algorithms and flat-histogram methods)

• Numerical study of first and second order phase transitions in magnetic systems
(the Ising model and generalizations)

• Solution of quantum one-body problems

• Quantum many-body problems and effective lattice models (e.g. spin chains and
Hubbard model)

• Hartree Fock

• Exact diagonalization of quantum lattice models

• Quantum Monte Carlo methods and the negative sign problem

• The density matrix renormalization group and tensor network methods
